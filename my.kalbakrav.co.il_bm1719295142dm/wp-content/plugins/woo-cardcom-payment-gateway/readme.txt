== Frequently asked questions ==

= I don't know what are my "Terminal number" and/or "API-Username" =
Go to [The CardCom management console](https://secure.cardcom.solutions/), and then navigate to "Settings" menu >> "1. Company setup" >> "4. Manage API-keys"
From there you may copy the keys, or have a copy sent over to your email. See also: [Support article](https://support.cardcom.solutions/hc/he/articles/360022382833)

= I'm having trouble getting into my CardCom management console =
You could reset a user's password quickly, by going to the "Forgot password" link on the log-in screen.
From there, enter the relevant Username, and their associated SMS/Email. You'll receive a One-Time password, and then be requested to set a new password.

= I'm still having trouble / cannot access management console =
If you need to, please call our Support team, to get further assistance -
IL Phone number: [+972-3-9436100](TEL:039436100), see also: [Contact-us Page](https://www.cardcom.co.il/Pages2/ContactUs.aspx)

= Checkout page is missing the "CardCom" payment option =
Make sure both that the plugin is ENABLED in your WordPress site (goto control-panel), And that it's ACTIVE for WooCommerce (see step-3 in the Installation guide)

= Cannot proceed from checkout to payment page choosing "CardCom" gateway =

The most likely explication is either:

1. You forgot to set some required parameter at setup
   (See: "Terminal number" and "API-Username")
2. Some feature is active, which requires a module you're not subscribed to in your CardCom account.

Example of the second issue may include,

* Setting "Invoice" is active, but your terminal lacks that module.
* You set "Operation" for an action that requires some module:
  * All of them require "Low-Profile Page" for the set terminal.
	* Ops with "Save Token" / "Capture Charge" - requires "Tokens".
	* Ops "Suspended Deal" (Deprecated) requires that module.

= My customers are not receiving their invoice =
Make sure your CardCom account has an active module for "Invoices",
And ensure the "Invoice" and "Send By Email" settings are enabled.
Contact [support team](https://support.cardcom.solutions/hc/he/articles/360007554833) for help with of the management console and reports.

= Payments are showing-up in reports, but orders stay "Pending payment" or "Cancelled" =
This is a potential issue with the site's hosting service. They may need to allow CardCom's servers & traffic in the host-firewall.
